		<blockquote cite="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/snow-leopard">What is the snow leopard?
			These spotted leopards live in the mountains across a vast range
			of Asia. They are insulated by thick hair—in shades of gray or 
			creamy yellow and covered with grayish black spots—and their wide, 
			fur-covered feet act as natural snowshoes. Snow leopards have powerful
			legs and are tremendous jumpers, able to leap as far as 50 feet. 
			These big cats use their long tails for balance and as blankets 
			to cover sensitive body parts against the severe mountain chill. 
			They are shy and reclusive, and rarely seen in the wild.
