## Portfolio Website
<p>This project is a portfolio in the form of a website that showcases the projects that I have worked on during my HTML and CSS course in the Tech Academy's Software Developer bootcamp.</p>


## Academy Cinemas
<p>This is an example website for a movie theater that I built using HTML and CSS. It shows a discription of the theater istself, movies that are currently showing with showtimes and discriptions of the movies as well as images from the films. There is also a section to sign up for a rewards program that will offer deals for members who decide to sign up. At the top of the site is a working navigation bar to jump to specific parts of the website.</p>
